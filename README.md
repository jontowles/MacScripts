The MacScripts repository is a collection of scripts/LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons that I have engineered to fill the gaps on MacOS where Apple doesn't provide Mac APIs.

We build shell scripts that we deploy via MDM Product Provisioning to ensure that devices run seamlessly and get as close to zero touch enrollment as possible.
